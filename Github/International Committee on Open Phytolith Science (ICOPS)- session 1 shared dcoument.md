**What?** 
The **International Committee on Open Phytolith Science (ICOPS)** has been created within the International Phytolith Society to work on increasing the knowledge of and implementation of open science practices in phytolith research. 

The current members of the committee are: Doris Barboni, Jennifer Bates, Abraham Dabengwa, Zachary C. Dunseth, Juan José García-Granero, Emma Karoune, Celine Kerfant, Carla Lancelotti, Marco Madella, Maria Gabriela Musaubach, Javier Ruiz-Pérez.

We currently have one funded project, the [FAIR Phytolith project](https://open-phytoliths.github.io/FAIR-phytoliths/), that is working to improve data sharing by investigating existing phytolith data and drawing up guidelines, with community input, for the implementation of the FAIR principles for existing and future phytolith data. You can watch an introductory talk about this project [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5475346). 

We will also be helping with the special issue on Phytoliths in Asia for the journal *Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology* - more details can be found [here](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/review-of-palaeobotany-and-palynology/call-for-papers/phytoliths-in-asia-reference-collections-modern-calibrations-and-applications-to-palaeoenvironment). This will be the first of its kind to ask authors to comply with good open science practices for all of the submissions and we will offer guidelines about this best practice to assist authors. 

**Who?** 
* **Phytolith researchers** but also other archaeobotanists and those in related fields are welcome. 
    * This training is to benefit all our community moving towards an open research approach.

## Space for you to write ideas and questions

## 2pm to 4pm UTC session

## What do you want to be able to do with Github?

### Add your ideas below:
* Archive data (open source) 
* data management & analysis, collaborating and sharing research, creating open source repositories
* Store code and data from my publications
* Open source repositories for data storage/sharing
* Collaborate on projects & and exchange repositories
* Make my data available at the end of my project (and also during it)  
* Access other researchers open code (R, etc)
*

## Making your first repo - questions?
*
*
*
*
*

## Using Markdown and formatting README.md - questions?
* Can you add images?
    * Yes using ![imagename](image-path) - you need to first put your image into the github repository or you can link to an online image. 
* 
*
*
*
*

## Adding a license - questions?
*
*
*
*
*
*

## Any other questions?
* SB - How many space (in term of GB) do we have in GitHub repository? There is a limit of 100 gigabytes for one repository, and 100 MB for any single file. I add here a link for further informations 
* https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage
*
*
*
*
## Session archive

## 9am to 11am UTC Session

## What do you want to be able to do with Github?

### Add your ideas below:
* data management and analysis 
* sharing R packages and functions
* Repository for published code linked to paper
* Getting feedback while working on R code and sharing the final script
* repository for data for Supplementary Info for papers 
* Project management 
*
*

## Making your first repo - questions?
* How much cloud storage space is allowed for uploaded files? 
* 100 MB but you can store data on Zenodo or Figshare (are easily linked to you r GitHub account) - thanks!
* 
*
*

## Using Markdown and formatting README.md - questions?
* what is the difference between hyphens and asterisks?
    * there is no difference - they both make bullet points and can also be used to make bold and italic text if put next to word with no space.
*
*
*
*
*

## Adding a license - questions?
*
*
*
*
*
*

## Any other questions, suggestions?
* JB - learning how to do the archiving push is something I would like to suggest for session 3 
* NC - I would be interested in learning how to link R to Github in future sessions :raised_hands:
